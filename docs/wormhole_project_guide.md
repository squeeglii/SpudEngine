You can have at-most 1 blue and 1 orange portal at a time.

***Camera Controls***

As standard, WASD and a mouse can be used to control the camera with a first-person fly camera.

For the sake of fair testing, there are a few pre-saved camera angles:

| Key | Location                      |
|-----|-------------------------------|
| i   | Void, far away from geometry. |
| o   | Origin point                  |
| p   |                               |
| j   |                               |
| k   |                               |
| l   |                               |
| b   |                               |
| n   |                               |
| m   |                               |
